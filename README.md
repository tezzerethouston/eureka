Sci-fi Dungeon Harvest Moon like or something?

### RLE jam (December 2021)
WIP for the Rogue Engine Jam (https://itch.io/jam/rlejam) \
Where we make a Rogue-like and its engine from scratch over a month

### Features
- Runs in the console
- Flickering lights in a small spaceship with a bit of dialog
- Teleporting to a rim planet to gather berries
- That's it so far

## Updates every day
